# Good day to you!

My name is Anton and here is my final project for RS School 2024 React course.

## Important considerations

Before running the app locally you should provide your firebase config data.
Create a file named .env.local at the root of the project. It should contain data in this format:

NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_data
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_data
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECTID=your_data
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_data
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_data
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_data

This data can be found in firebase console settings https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/
If your team implemented firebase registration on the sever with session management in remote database let me know ðŸ˜Š. I'd be exited to see how exactly it should be implemented.
